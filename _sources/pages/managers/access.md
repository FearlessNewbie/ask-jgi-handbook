# Communications and Access

New Ask-JGI team members will require access to the following services.
The JGI Staff Data Scientist in charge of Ask-JGI will have access to make these changes.

## Ask-JGI Teams channel and SharePoint

All team members should be added to the [Ask-JGI Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19:R0mjpTn4_jzlZocsu-My0sSS0itzKTKFprXUbf4qp8s1@thread.tacv2/Ask-JGI%2520channel?groupId=ab55d7dd-aaf0-40b3-99c0-27efd424750f&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) within the Jean Golding Institute Team on Microsoft Teams.

This will also give them access to the [Ask-JGI SharePoint folder](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam-ask-jgi/) for storing information about projects and completing timesheets.

## Ask-JGI Tracker

All team members should be added to the [Ask-JGI Tracker](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker) via the [Ask-JGI Tracker users](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=1001) group on SharePoint.

## Shared mailbox

All team members should be added to the [Ask-JGI Inbox](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/) via the [shared mailboxes admin tool](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/applications/shared-mailboxes/sharedmailbox/MDAwNDk4NTY). Further [instructions for requesting and managing shared mailboxes](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/systemsupport/SitePages/online-shared-mailbox-admin.aspx) are available from IT Services.

## GitHub team
