# Contract and working hours

```{important}
Please note the University [guidance on working part time](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/part-time-work/) during your studies.
PhD students contributing to the Ask-JGI team must have the approval of their supervisors, and should agree an upper limit on the number of hours they should be dedicating to Ask-JGI each month.
```

Most Ask-JGI student contracts are handled by the University of Bristol's [Temporary Staffing Service (TSS)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/temporary-staffing/).
This is the case for candidates who meet the following criteria:

- Will be based in the UK for the duration of the contract.
- Do not hold any other employment contracts at the University of Bristol.
  
Assuming the above criteria are fulfilled, a [Casual, Academic and Guest request](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/temporary-staffing/cag/managers/request/) should be made by the JGI admin team.
This must be sent to TSS **at least 3 weeks** prior to the commencement of Ask-JGI activities.

To claim payment each month, students will need to ensure that their timesheet (a shared Excel spreadsheet) is up to date before the end of each month.
A member of the JGI admin team shoul send a reminder in the Microsoft Teams channel with the exact deadline each month.
After checking the hours, a JGI admin team member will then submit the total hours using a MyERP timesheet.

There are some cases where the above criteria do not apply (see below subsections).

## Student already employed through UoB HR

In cases where a student is already a staff member at the University, a payment route has already been set up through HR. This means that hours worked on Ask-JGI must be claimed by the student through MyERP using a **Staff Fee Claim** form.

The student will require a budget code and hourly rate (excluding holiday pay as annual leave benefits are already included as part of their main contract) from the Ask-JGI manager.

## Student based remotely, including internationally

```{important}
We expect most students to be physically based in Bristol and be available to attend in-person meetings during their time as part of the Ask-JGI team.
```

In cases where a student is going to be based away from Bristol for part of their contract, they should check this first with the Ask-JGI manager.
Where they will be oversea, then a special exception must also be sought through the [International Mobility Office](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/hr/policies/international-mobility/).
Provided that the International Mobility team are able to approve the circumstances a TSS contract ought to be able to be drawn up for a duration of 6 months (maximum for overseas-based workers).
