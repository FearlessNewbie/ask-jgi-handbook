# Getting started

Before you begin your first Ask-JGI shift you will need to make sure
that you are able to access some platforms, pages and groups. Please
see the sections below for instructions on how to get yourself ready
for your first shift.

## Communicating on Teams

The platform that the Ask-JGI team uses to stay in touch on a
day-to-day basis is Microsoft Teams. The Jean Golding Institute uses
Teams to stay in touch with other team members, and to share ideas, events and
opportunities with each other.
There is a Teams channel specifically for the Ask-JGI team - you will be given access by a member of JGI staff.

The Teams channel is also used for the weekly Ask-JGI meetings.

## Getting set up with SharePoint

When you are added to the Ask-JGI Teams channel, you should be automatically granted access to the
Ask-JGI SharePoint folder, which can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Shared%20Documents/Ask-JGI?csf=1&web=1&e=imr5IE).
In this folder you will be able to store files related to any of your queries, such as meeting notes or code examples.

While working with Ask-JGI you will be expected to
attend weekly catch-up meetings with the rest of the team. 
The Ask-JGI weekly meetings are managed through the Teams channel.

Login using your UoB account.

## Ask-JGI mailbox access

A major part of your duties while undertaking shifts for Ask-JGI will
be to monitor the Ask-JGI mailbox. 

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the mailbox
[here](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/inbox).
Contact the Ask-JGI lead in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.

## Ask-JGI tracker access

Any new query that is submitted to Ask-JGI results in a ticket being
opened on the [Ask-JGI tracker](tracker).

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the tracker
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker).
Contact the Ask-JGI lead in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.

# Storing data and writing code

We recommend that, where possible, code and data are shared openly. This could be on a public GitHub repository, either under the [Jean Golding Institute GitHub](https://github.com/JGIBristol/Ask-JGI) GitHub, or on your own account. You will be given access to the Ask-JGI GitHub repo during your induction.

When a project is shared publicly, we ask that the README file or front page contains the attribution "Supported by the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/)'s Ask-JGI service".

```{warning}
If your project is working with sensitive data or code, check with the person that raised the query where the best place to store things is, and whether it is appropriate to share things publicly.
```

If it is not appropriate to share things publicly, then you should store files and data in a secure place. One such place is the [Projects folder on the Ask-JGI SharePoint](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Shared%20Documents/Ask-JGI/SHARED/Projects?csf=1&web=1&e=PteIIp).
