# Data science shifts

The postgraduate team working on Ask-JGI are expected to work
collaboratively to manage the Ask-JGI mailbox. This activity has been
designed to allow ad-hoc working, so that queries can be picked up
within the constraints of Ask-JGI student PhD studies and other
work/university commitments. 

To make sure that there is always at least one team member checking
the Ask-JGI mailbox a throughout the day, Ask-JGI students are
required to sign up for so-called **data science shifts**. Typically one or 
two students will be "on shift" (see [here](organization) for more details).
Students on shift will keep the rest of the team up-to-date at [Weekly
meetings](meetings). 

More information on these data science shifts can be found in the
upcoming sections of this book, or directly through the following links:
