# Claiming payment

### Temporary Staffing Service (TSS) Claims

To claim for hours worked each month, Ask-JGI team members will
need to complete their timesheet and send the form to
their Ask-JGI manager for approval. 

Information on this process can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/myerp/SitePages/cag-casual-academics-and-guests.aspx).



### Staff Fee Claims

In cases where a student is already a staff member at the University,
a payment route has already been set up through HR. This means that
hours worked on Ask-JGI must be claimed by the student through MyERP
using a **Staff Fee Claim** form.

Guidance for making payment claims in this way can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/myerp/SitePages/Getting-paid-staff-fees.aspx).
